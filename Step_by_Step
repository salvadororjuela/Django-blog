1. CREATE THE PROJECT
	A. Create the project folder and subfolders use the command
		
		i. django-admin startproject blog_app_project.
		
	B. Create the first application to manage the html layout, homepage with all articles to display, each individual article, and new articles to post.
		
		i. python3 manage.py startapp blog.
		
	C. Register the application blog in blog_app_project/settings.py
		
		INSTALLED_APPS = [
			'blog',
			'users',
			'django.contrib.admin',
			.
			.
			.
		]
	
	D. Create the route to the application urls.py file of each application in blog_app_project/urls.py
		
		from django.contrib import admin
		from django.urls import path, include
		from django.contrib.staticfiles.urls import staticfiles_urlpatterns
		from django.conf.urls.static import static
		from django.conf import settings
		# Necessary for redirecting the homepage
		from blog import views (This is necessary for the following step)


		urlpatterns = [
			path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
			path("blog/", include("blog.urls")), 
			path("users/", include("users.urls")),
			# Redirects the homepage to the url http://127.0.0.1:8000/
			path("", views.index, name="index")
		]
	
	E. In the folder "blog" created in the B step, create a new file called urls.py and include the following information.
	
		from django.urls import path
		from . import views


		# Namespace urls to avoid conflict with urls named the same way in
		# other app folders
		app_name = "blog" # Importat for name space on each urls.py file in each app.

		urlpatterns = [
			# Path to the home web with the list of articles
			path("", views.index, name="index"),
			# Path to create new articles by registered users
			path("newarticle", views.newarticle_view, name="newarticle"),
			# The slug path must be below any other paths that use slug as an argument
			# because the slug is the final parth of the url in the browser.
			path("<slug>", views.article_detail, name="article_detail"),
		]
	
	F. The file blog/views.py will manage the actions taken every time a url path is taken. This will be explained when actions are added througout this document.
	

2. HTML TEMPLATES

	A. Create the folder blog/templates/blog/ and inside this create the templates layout.html, articleContent.html, index.html, newarticle.html.
	
	
	
3. CREATE index FUNCTIONS IN BLOG/VIEWS.PY 
	
	i. Actions to take are to be included in blog/views.py as functions (i.e...
	
		from django.contrib.auth import forms
		from django.shortcuts import render
		from .models import Articles
		# Required to access to websites where log in is required
		from django.contrib.auth.decorators import login_required
		# Import the file where the forms are created
		from . import forms


		# Create your views here.
		def index(request):
			return render(request, "blog/index.html", {
				"Articles": Articles.objects.all().order_by("date")
			})
		)
		
4. CREATE THE MODEL FOR THE DATABASE TABLE

	from django.db import models
	from django.contrib.auth.models import User


	# Create your models here.
	class Articles(models.Model):
		title = models.CharField(max_length=150, unique=True)
		# slug is a newspaper term. It is short label generally used in URLs
		# and contain only letters, numbers, underscores or hyphens.
		slug = models.SlugField()
		body = models.TextField()
		# Field authomatically populated when the user submits the article
		date = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
		# Field to add a thumbnail for the blog article
		thumbnail = models.ImageField(default="default.png", blank=True)
		# Field to associate the articles with the user that created it
		author = models.ForeignKey(User, default=None, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

		# Returns the title content in a human readable fashion
		def __str__(self):
		    return self.title

		"""Method to return only a part of the body and display this snippet
		instead of the whole body of the article"""
		def snippet(self):
		    return f"{self.body[:100]}..."


5. MIGRATE (Each time you make major changes to the model)

	i. Migrate updates the changes on the application database
	
	ii. python3 manage.py makemigrations
	
	iii. python3 manage.py migrate
	
	Note: The changes will be registered inside blog/migratios. Every time a migration is done, a new file is created inside this folder with the registered changes.
	
6. REGISTER THE MODEL INTO blog/admin.py TO UPDATE THE ADMIN SECTION OF DJANGO
	
	from django.contrib import admin
	from .models import Articles


	# Register your models here.
	admin.site.register(Articles)
	
7. DJANGO ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
